# ***S53_Weirdest_Fashion***


## *IDEA*

The idea is to have a project named Weirdest Fashion. This will include pretty wild fashion like wearing a dress that looks like a giant bubble or suit shaped like a paper bag. These outfits aren't just strange, they're statements, asking questions about what fashion can be and who gets to decide what's "normal".

These ideas may feel a bit funny, shocking, and even a bit strange, but these weird fashion outfits are actually a fashion explorer's wild ride creativity.

This project will lead you to diving into a crazy closet, leaving you both amazed and maybe a bit of confused at the same time, but definitely will inspire to think outside of the box next time you get dressed.

## *FEATURES*
